BlueDroid is a Android app designed for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) advertising spam. It is intended for authorized penetration testing and security research in controlled environments.

## Features

- **BLE Advertising Spam**  
  Simulates multiple fake Bluetooth devices to flood nearby device lists and notifications.

- **Dark Theme Interface**  
  Modern, sleek dark theme for a professional pentest experience.

- **Permission Handling**  
  Checks for required permissions at runtime, ensuring compliance with Android security standards.

## How It Works

1. **Start Advertising**  
   - Tap "Start Advertising" to begin broadcasting fake BLE advertisements.
   - Nearby devices will detect these as new Bluetooth devices, often triggering notifications or popups.

2. **Spam Effect**  
   - The app floods the area with fake advertisements, overwhelming device lists and notifications.
   - This helps test how devices and apps react to Bluetooth spam.

3. **Stop Advertising**  
   - Tap "Stop Advertising" to end the broadcast.
   - The spam effect stops, and nearby devices will no longer see the fake entries.
